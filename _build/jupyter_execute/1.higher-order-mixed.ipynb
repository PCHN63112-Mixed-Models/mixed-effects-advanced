    "When we looked at the repeated measures ANOVA model a couple of weeks ago, we saw that the framework really started to fall apart once we had between-subject factors as well as multiple within-subject factors. As such, we also need to examine how mixed-effects models behave in these situations to assess whether they continue to provide a viable alternative.\n",
