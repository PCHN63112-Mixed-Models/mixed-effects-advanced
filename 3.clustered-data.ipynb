    "### 1. Identify the Structure\n",
    "We already discussed identifying the structure of a dataset at the beginning of this lesson. We are also organising these examples *by structure*, so this first step is somewhat redundant. However, we will keep it here for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we need to identify our *unit of analysis*. This is the element of the data that we are trying to make inferences on. So, in this example, our units are *individual rat pups*. Our primary question is about how the treatments affect the weight of the rat pups, so these are clearly the units of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, we need to determine what each row of the data represents. As we can see above, each row corresponds to only a single unit measured *once*. So this *could* be *clustered* data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the final step, we need to determine if there are any clusters. If there are, we use a multilevel/LME approach. If there are not, the data are known as *cross-sectional* and we go back to plain old linear regression. So, we look and see whether there are any variables that are *constant* across multiple units. In this example, there are several: `sex`, `litter`, `litsize` and `treatment`. The important question is whether any of these represent a *shared latent influence* that could affect the correlation? If we think back to our *sticky notes* vs *rubber bands* metaphor, what elements of the data tie all those shared units together and which are labels that we give those units? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `sex`, `litsize` and `treatment` are all *sticky notes*. They are *labels* given to each individual unit. They describe a *characteristic* of the pup or a *characteristic* of their environment, but they do not tie them together. By comparison, `litter` itself is a *rubber band*. All pups from the same litter are tied together by the biological reality of sharing a mother, genes, siblings and rearing environment. So, our conclusion is that `litter` *is* a clustering variable. All pups from the same `litter` are therefore expected to be correlated to some degree."

    "You may find `litsize` a confusing inclusion because it *refers* to litter and thus sounds like it should relate to clustering. However, this is a *description* rather than a structure. The way to think about it is if, hypothetically, litter size was a *rubber band* it would mean that all pups from litters of the same size were connected, irrespective of their mother, rearing environment or siblings. So, it is simply the total number of pups in the litter that matters biologically, rather than anything else. Thus all pups from a litter of size 8 would be connected together. Their mother, genetics and other factors *do not matter*. Consider for yourself whether this sounds plausible and thus whether you think `litsize` should be treated as a *rubber band* or a *sticky note*. \n",
